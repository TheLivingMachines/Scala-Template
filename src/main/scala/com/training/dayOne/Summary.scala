    * You have seen simple elements of functional programming in Scala.
    * 1. arithmetic and boolean expressions
    * 2. conditional expression if-else
    * 3. functions with recursion
    * 4. nesting and lexical scope
    *
    *
    * You have learned the difference between the call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation strategies.
    * You have learned a way to reason about program execution: reduce expression using the substitution model.
    * This model will be an important tool for all the concepts in Scala.
