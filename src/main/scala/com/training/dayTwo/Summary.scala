  /**
    * We have seen that the functions are essential abstractions
    * because they allow us to introduce general methods to perform
    * computations as explicit and named elements in our programming
    * language.
    *
    * We have seen that these abstractions can be combined
    * with higher-order functions to create new abstractions.
    *
    * As a programmer, one must look for opportunities to abstract and reuse.
    *
    * The higher level of abstraction is not always the best, but it is
    * important to know the techniques of abstractions, so as to use
    * them when appropriate.
